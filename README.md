# 3D Tic Tac Toe Bot

Welcome to the 3D Tic Tac Toe Bot repository! In this project, we are working on creating a bot that can play 3D Tic Tac Toe on a 4x4x4 grid. This repository contains the research and development efforts for building an intelligent and strategic bot that can compete with human players in this challenging game.

## Project Overview
3D Tic Tac Toe is an extension of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, played on a 4x4x4 grid. The objective is to form a line of four markers in any direction: horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or along one of the four main space diagonals. The game presents unique challenges due to the added dimension, making it an interesting and complex problem for bot development.

## Goals
Our goal is to create a bot that can play 3D Tic Tac Toe at a high level of skill, employing strategic thinking and intelligent decision-making. We aim to develop algorithms and heuristics that enable the bot to anticipate and respond to opponent moves, while also seeking opportunities to create winning positions.

## Repository Contents
